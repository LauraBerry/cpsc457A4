questions and notes:

1) 	what is the critical section's data type?
	deflected question, will go over in next tutorial -> implied it's Mutex
	
2) 	is a linked list zero indexed?
	doesn't matter as long as we document it (we decide how to use the get(index) function ourselves)

3) 	what does it mean when it says return a pair?(split method)
	there is a Pair class

4) 	what is the equivalent of Node a.next in class T?
	wrapped T in the Node class -> did not confirm but that's what I did, it seems to be okay
	
5)	what does the iterator do exactly?
	used in the tests, we have to implement ourselves
	be careful - might fail or never finish
	avoid restarting from start of the list every time
	don't use get in iterator
	
6) 	where do we decide what the depth limit is?
	from the thread number, not hard coded (do in constructor)

7) 	how do we decide how many threads we need? we are currently using listSize/depthLimit
	we decided it ourselves it should be the other way around

8) 	what is comp in merge sort?
	the compare function that defines that it is ascending

9) 	how to get a specific thread from the pool?
	

10) how to set it up such that each thread does something?
