questions and notes:

1) 	what is the critical section's data type?
	deflected question, will go over in next tutorial -> implied it's Mutex
	
2) 	is a linked list zero indexed?
	doesn't matter as long as we document it (we decide how to use the get(index) function ourselves)

3) 	what does it mean when it says return a pair?(split method)
	there is a Pair class

4) 	what is the equivalent of Node a.next in class T?
	wrapped T in the Node class -> did not confirm but that's what I did, it seems to be okay
	
5)what does the iterator do exactly?

6) where do we decide what the depth limit is?

7) how do we decide how many threads we need? we are currently using listSize/depthLimit

8) what is comp in merge sort?

9) how to get a specific thread from the pool?


	-he implied that size should be of type T instead of int.
